Buildbot Meggy Jr. Display widget.

This program will display your buildbot status on a Meggy Jr.

Requirements:
   * A buildbot server
   * A Meggy Jr (get it from the Evil Mad Scientist)
   * An RS-232 cord for your Meggy.  Get that from the evil scientist as well.

Howto
-----
1) Program your Meggy Jr wtih the MeggyJr_RemoteDraw_115200.pde
2) configure your mjbb.ini file.  Should be pretty self-explanatory.
3) run the program.

That's about it.

Well, I modded muy MeggyJr so that it runs from the 5V on the RS-232 cable, rather than batteries.
